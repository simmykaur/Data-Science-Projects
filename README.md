# Data-Science-Projects
A portfolio of professional academic projects I completed during my time as an undergraduate student at UCSB. 

1) Description of Marriage Dissolution in the United States Project: 
   An academic group project completed for PSTAT 175 under the supervision of Professor Andrew Carter at UCSB.
   My group was interested in seeing how the different covariates affect the survival probability of the couple’s marriages, 
   and we aimed to examine the interactions between the covariates to see if any of these interactions are significant. 
   Furthermore, we were also interested in seeing whether or not the covariates have differing effects on the probability of
   divorce depending on how long a couple has been married. We initially hypothesized that the hazard rate is high at the 
   beginning of a marriage, and that, after a certain point in time, the hazard rate will decrease significantly. 
   Our ultimate goal for this project is to test whether or not this hypothesis was true by using various statistical 
   tools to successfully manipulate and analyze our data.

2) Description of Impact of Demographic Characteristics of a Country on COVID Vaccine Distribution and Manufacturer Prevalence Project: 
   This group data science projected was completed for PSTAT 100 under the supervision of Professor Trevor Ruiz at UCSB. We utilized advanced Python libraries to            
   understand how a country’s demographic statistics impact the total number of vaccinations per hundred people. We utilized Python to perform Principal Component 
   Analysis, Regression Analysis, various visual explorations to discern relationships among various country’s socioeconomic factors and vaccination rates. 
   
 3) Description of Classification of the 2016 General Election Project: 
    This group project was completed for PSTAT 131 under the supervision of Professor Trevor Ruiz. My group analyzed how demographic variables at the county level 
    played into the winner of each county race in the U.S. 2016 Election using advanced libraries in R. Moreover, we conducted statistical analysis through 
    visualizations, regression model fitting, and other analysis techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
